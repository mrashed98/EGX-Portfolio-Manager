# Stock Details Page UI Fixes

**Date:** October 9, 2025  
**Stock:** RACC (Reference)

## Issues Identified & Fixed

### 1. OHLC Prices Display ✅

**Issue:** All OHLC values (Open, High, Low) were showing the same value (10.68 EGP) because they were all falling back to `stock.current_price` when the specific fields were null.

**Root Cause:** The stock object didn't have `open_price`, `high_price`, `low_price` populated from the API.

**Fix:**
- Created `getLatestOHLC()` helper function that retrieves actual OHLC data from the `priceHistory` array
- Updated all OHLC StatCards to use this function
- Added a **Close** price card (was missing)
- Changed grid from 4 columns to 5 columns to accommodate all OHLC + Volume

**Result:**
```typescript
// Before: All showed 10.68 EGP
Open: 10.68 | High: 10.68 | Low: 10.68 | Volume: 10,121,418

// After: Shows real historical data
Open: 9.97 | High: 10.84 | Low: 9.70 | Close: 10.68 | Volume: 10,121,418
```

### 2. Technical Indicators - Color Coding ✅

**Issue:** Technical indicators were displayed in plain text with no visual indication of whether they were bullish, bearish, or neutral for the stock.

**Fix:**
- Added `getIndicatorColor()` function with intelligent color coding:
  - **RSI:** Green (<30 oversold), Red (>70 overbought), Yellow (neutral)
  - **MACD:** Green (positive), Red (negative)
  - **Stochastic:** Green (<20), Red (>80), Yellow (neutral)
  - **ADX:** Green (>25 strong trend), Yellow (weak trend)
  - **CCI:** Green (<-100), Red (>100), Yellow (neutral)
  - **Moving Averages:** Green (price above MA), Red (price below MA), Yellow (equal)
- Added `getIndicatorBg()` function for background colors:
  - `bg-green-50 border-green-200` for bullish
  - `bg-red-50 border-red-200` for bearish
  - `bg-yellow-50 border-yellow-200` for neutral
- Each indicator card now has:
  - Colored text for the value
  - Matching colored background
  - Clear visual indication of market sentiment

**Example:**
```
RSI: 93.87 (Red background - Overbought)
MACD: 0.67 (Green background - Bullish)
SMA20: 7.97 (Red background - Price above MA)
```

### 3. Technical Indicators - Collapsible ✅

**Issue:** All 81 technical indicators were displayed at once, cluttering the page.

**Fix:**
- Added `indicatorsExpanded` state variable
- Show only 12 indicators by default
- Added "Show All (81)" / "Show Less" button in the card header
- Button includes ChevronDown/ChevronUp icons
- Smooth transition when expanding/collapsing
- Total indicator count displayed in the button

**Result:**
- Initially shows 12 most important indicators

- Much cleaner, more organized interface
